# Movie Rental API (ASP.NET Core + SQL Server)

A RESTful backend for a movie-rental service. It lets clients **register/login users**, **browse/manage movies**, and **rent/return movies**. Data access runs through a small DAL that calls **SQL Server stored procedures**, and passwords are protected with **PBKDF2** hashing.
